### What is this repository for? ###

Data and code for evaluating various methods that infer a person's gender from the name string.


## How to fetch gender from an API

TODO: transfer code from notebook `Fetch_gender.ipynb` plus some comments; then notebook not required anymore

## Extend code by new Evaluator class

Need to create a sub-directory of `test_data/raw_data` having the same name as the evaluator (class attribute `gender_evalauator`)
